# lc101FinalProject
Capstone Project Plan
Overview & Features

My project is a schedule creation and viewing application for use by small businesses that replaces paper printouts of excel spread sheets, helps manage and view labor hours and costs, facilitates communication between employees so that availability issues can be easily resolved. It will have separate accounts for each employee with pertinent information available to them. Eventually I would like to make it mobile friendly, and available through phone app-stores.

I got this idea from working for small businesses for many years that don't capitalise on or don't have access to a full blown enterprise resource planning program.

Features

Features for the Business:

Admin log in that allows creation, editing, and removal or schedules and employees.
Admin log in that allows oversight of shift exchanges
Admin log in that allows some form of dashboard for viewing labor data.
Features for Employees:

User log in that has a dashboard showing current and possibly future schedules.
Mechanism for facilitating a shift exchange to resolve availability issues.
Later down the road:

I believe the above features combined with a robust and secure user login will meet the criteria for the scope of this project but eventually I would like to include;

Some sort of an employee benefits system, that for example calculates a 'employee benefit dollar amount' based on hours worked so the employee receives an allowence to be spent at the business, I've seen this work well in real world businesses as it keeps track of types of loss, reduces theft and in some cases can be a tax write off.

Some mechanism for employees to communicate with eachother whether it be SMS or an in app chat feature.
